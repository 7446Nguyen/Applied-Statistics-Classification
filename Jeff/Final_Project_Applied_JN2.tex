\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{The result of the Bartlett's test returned statistically significant results, indicating the null hypothesis of linearity must be rejected in favor of the alternate, which is that the discriminant boundary is non-linear. Consequently, we proceed with a model based on \texttt{Quadratic\ Discriminant\ Analysis} to provide predictive responses from a discriminant model. However, we proceed with caution, as the quadratic version of the discriminant analysis is at greater risk for over-fitting to the data than Linear Discriminant Analysis as the boundary is required to conform more closely to the data rather than to the mean of the data. This was also taken into consideration when assessing the results of the Logistic Regression model development that occurs afterward. Bartlett's Test of this data set yielded a significant p-value, where p \textless{} 0.0001, indicating that the proportion of distribution beyond the derrived test statistic is beyond that which could be explained by chance.

\subsubsection{After identifying that the forward selected model is the best candidate based on it's AIC and residual deviance, its features are tuned using an internal cross validation. A training set is generated by randomly selecting 75\% of the observations, with the remaining 25\% serving as the validation (test) set. The model is tuned using 25 folds and is repeated 5 times, this process is the same as described in section 5.0.1. Prior to the internal cross validation process, action types that rarely occur in the data are recoded to similar, but differ action types, i.e.~``Running Tip Shot'' (1 observation) to ``Tip Shot'' (many observations). If levels within the evaluation data exist but are not present in the training data, a trained model will have difficulty making predictions. Infrequently occurring action types are recoded to similar action types to avoid this situation.}\label{after-identifying-that-the-forward-selected-model-is-the-best-candidate-based-on-its-aic-and-residual-deviance-its-features-are-tuned-using-an-internal-cross-validation.-a-training-set-is-generated-by-randomly-selecting-75-of-the-observations-with-the-remaining-25-serving-as-the-validation-test-set.-the-model-is-tuned-using-25-folds-and-is-repeated-5-times-this-process-is-the-same-as-described-in-section-5.0.1.-prior-to-the-internal-cross-validation-process-action-types-that-rarely-occur-in-the-data-are-recoded-to-similar-but-differ-action-types-i.e.-running-tip-shot-1-observation-to-tip-shot-many-observations.-if-levels-within-the-evaluation-data-exist-but-are-not-present-in-the-training-data-a-trained-model-will-have-difficulty-making-predictions.-infrequently-occurring-action-types-are-recoded-to-similar-action-types-to-avoid-this-situation.}}
